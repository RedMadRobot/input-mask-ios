 ### CaretStringIterator

     Inspect, whether ```CaretStringIterator``` has reached ```CaretString.caretPosition``` or not.
     
     Each ```CaretString``` object contains cursor position for its ```CaretString.string```. 
     
     For the ```Mask``` instance it is important to know, whether it should adjust the cursor position or not when
     inserting new symbols into the formatted line.
     
     **Example**
     
     Let the ```CaretString``` instance contains two symbols, with the caret at the end of the line.
     ```
     string:    ab
     caret:      ^
     ```
     In this case ```CaretStringIterator.beforeCaret()``` will always return ```true``` until there's no more
     characters left in the line to iterate over.
     
     **Example 2**
     
     Let the ```CaretString``` instance contains two symbols, with the caret at the beginning of the line.
     ```
     string:    ab
     caret:     ^
     ```
     In this case ```CaretStringIterator.beforeCaret()``` will only return ```true``` for the first iteration. After the
     ```next()``` method is fired, ```beforeCaret()``` will return false.
     
     - returns: ```True```, if current iterator position is less than or equal to ```CaretString.caretPosition```
